weft is a program that takes a mail/news message and formats it for
displaying on the web.

Its main design goal was to be fast and simple.  

It was written by and is copyright (c) 2003-2011 Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen
<larsi@gnus.org>.  It's released under the GNU General Public License,
a copy of which is included in this package.

Debian package names here):
