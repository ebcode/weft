weft is a program that takes a mail/news message and formats it for
displaying on the web.

Its main design goal was to be fast and simple.  

It was written by and is copyright (c) 2003 Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen
<larsi@gnus.org>.  It's released under the GNU General Public License,
a copy of which is included in this package.

weft requires the following libraries to compile (and I've given the
Debian package names here):

libgmime-dev
libglib1.2-dev
libcompfaceg1-dev
libmagick5-dev
libxml2-dev
xslt1-dev

Plus

picons-*

if you want to display picons.
